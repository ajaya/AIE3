Based on the provided context, here are some tips for being an effective CEO:
1. Look for someone who is hungry and driven, someone who wants a shot at doing "their thing".
2. Beware of hiring executives who have "done it before" and may not be as hungry or driven.
3. Don't disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness, as long as they are not insane. Great executives are high-ego and confident in their abilities.
4. When hiring an executive to run a former specialty of yours, be cautious not to purposefully hire someone weak in that area.
5. Reduce layers of management in your company and promote up and coming leaders who are ambitious and want to see both themselves and the company succeed.
These tips can help in effectively managing and leading a company as a CEO.
