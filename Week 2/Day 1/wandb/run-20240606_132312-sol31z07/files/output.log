Based on the context provided, here are some tips for being an effective CEO:
1. Nuke underperforming managers and promote top up-and-comers: Identify and promote your top 20 or 30 strong, sharp, ambitious managers to be in charge of key teams and missions, with minimal layers of management between you and them.
2. Focus on winning at the single most important thing: Identify the critical area your company needs to excel in and assign your best person to lead that effort.
3. Use incentives effectively: Transparency, clear performance evaluation, and appropriate incentives can motivate employees to perform at their best and drive company success.
4. Avoid micromanaging: Trust your executives to do their job and give them the autonomy to run their teams effectively. Micromanagement can hinder their performance and impact morale.
5. Hire the right CEO or sell the company: If you don't have a capable CEO within your founding team, consider selling the company. Choosing the right leader is crucial for the success of the business.
